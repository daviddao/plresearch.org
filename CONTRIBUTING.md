# Contributing to the PL Research Website

This guide explains how focus area leads and contributors can add and edit content on the Protocol Labs R&D website (https://plresearch.org).

## Focus Area Pages

Three focus areas are fully managed through Markdown: **Digital Human Rights**, **AI & Robotics**, and **Neurotech**. Each focus area lead can update their page by editing a single file.

> **Note:** The Upgrade Economies & Governance focus area is managed separately — see [FA2 Data](#fa2-data-upgrade-economies--governance) below.

### File Locations

| Focus Area | File | Lead |
|------------|------|------|
| Digital Human Rights | `content/areas/digital-human-rights/_index.md` | Will Scott |
| AI & Robotics | `content/areas/ai-robotics/_index.md` | Molly Mackinlay |
| Neurotech | `content/areas/neurotech/_index.md` | Sean Escola |

### Frontmatter Fields

Each file starts with a YAML frontmatter block between `---` markers. Here is what each field does:

```yaml
---
title: "Neurotech"
date: 2024-03-15
summary: "Accelerate neurotechnologies to benefit humanity, focusing on breakthroughs in brain-computer interfaces (BCI)."
leads:
  - sean-escola
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | The page heading. Displayed prominently at the top of the area page. Any `FA1:` / `FA2:` prefix is automatically stripped for display. |
| `date` | Yes | Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Used for metadata and ordering. Not shown on the page. |
| `summary` | Yes | One or two sentences shown as the subtitle below the heading. Also used as the page's meta description for search engines. |
| `leads` | Yes | List of author slugs (folder names from `content/authors/`). Each lead is displayed as a card with their name, role, and avatar. Use `leads: []` if there are no designated leads. |

### Page Body (Markdown)

Everything below the closing `---` is the page body. It is rendered as HTML and displayed as the main content section. Standard Markdown is supported:

- `## Heading` for section headers
- `**bold**` and `*italic*` for emphasis
- `- item` for bullet lists
- `[link text](url)` for links
- Code blocks with triple backticks

The page also automatically shows up to 8 recent publications and 6 recent talks that are tagged with the area's slug in their `areas:` frontmatter.

### Example: Updating Your Focus Area

Say you are the Neurotech lead and want to update the summary and add a paragraph:

1. Open `content/areas/neurotech/_index.md`
2. Edit the `summary:` value and add text below the `---`
3. Preview locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # open http://localhost:3000/areas/neurotech/
   ```
4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b update-neurotech-summary
   git add content/areas/neurotech/_index.md
   git commit -m "🔧 Update neurotech summary and description"
   git push -u origin update-neurotech-summary
   ```
5. Open a pull request. Once merged to `main`, Vercel auto-deploys.

### Adding or Changing a Lead

The `leads` field references author slugs. Each slug must match a folder in `content/authors/`. To add a new lead:

1. Ensure the person has an author profile (see [Add a Team Member](#add-a-team-member) below)
2. Add their slug to the `leads` list:
   ```yaml
   leads:
     - sean-escola
     - new-lead-slug
   ```

## How Content Works

All website content lives in the `content/` directory as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. When the site builds, a script converts these files into JSON that the website reads:

```
You edit:          content/publications/my-paper/index.md
                        |
Build script:      scripts/build-content.mjs  (runs automatically)
                        |
Generates:         src/data/generated/publications.json
                        |
Displayed at:      https://plresearch.org/publications/my-paper/
```

You only need to create or edit Markdown files in `content/`. Everything else is automatic.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daviddao/plrd-v2.git
cd plrd-v2
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to preview the site. Changes to `content/` files require restarting the dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev` again).

and formal verification of distributed systems.

Her recent work focuses on Byzantine fault tolerance in heterogeneous networks.
She previously held research positions at EPFL and the Max Planck Institute.
```

**Avatar image:** Place the photo at `public/images/authors/jane-smith/avatar.jpg`. The filename must start with `avatar` (e.g., `avatar.jpg`, `avatar.png`, `avatar.webp`). Recommended size: 400x400px, square crop.

### Add a Publication

Create a folder in `content/publications/` using a slug (typically `lastnameYYYY`), with an `index.md` file inside.

**File:** `content/publications/smith2025/index.md`

```yaml
---
# Paper title (required)
title: "Scalable Byzantine Agreement with Adaptive Adversaries"

# Publication date, format YYYY-MM-DD (required)
date: 2025-01-15

# Venue name (optional)
venue: "ACM CCS 2025"

# Venue location (optional)
venue_location: "Salt Lake City, UT, USA"

# Venue date if different from publication date (optional, format YYYY-MM-DD)
venue_date: 2025-11-10

# DOI if available (optional)
doi: "10.1145/1234567.1234568"

# Publication type -- pick one (required):
#   conference-paper, journal-article, report, preprint, book-chapter
publication_types:
  - conference-paper

# Authors (required)
# For PL team members: use their folder slug (e.g., jane-smith)
# For external authors: use their full name in quotes (e.g., "Alice Johnson")
authors:
  - jane-smith
  - "Alice Johnson"
  - "Bob Williams"

# Focus areas -- use folder slugs from content/areas/ (optional)
areas:
  - distributed-systems

# Research groups (optional)
groups:
  - consensuslab

# Set to true for papers without PL affiliation that should only
# appear on the author's profile, not in the main publications list
unaffiliated: false

# External links (optional)
url_pdf: ""
url_source: "https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/001"
---
We present a new protocol for Byzantine agreement that scales to thousands
of participants while maintaining security against adaptive adversaries.
Our approach combines threshold signatures with a novel view-change mechanism
that reduces communication complexity from O(n^3) to O(n log n).
```

The body text below the `---` becomes the abstract/description on the publication page. It supports full Markdown (bold, links, lists, etc.).

**PDF files:** If you have a PDF, name it the same as the folder (e.g., `smith2025.pdf`) and place it in the folder. Note that `*.pdf` files are gitignored, so PDFs should be hosted externally and linked via `url_pdf`.

### Add a Talk

Create a folder in `content/talks/` with an `index.md` file.

**File:** `content/talks/smith-ccs2025/index.md`

```yaml
---
# Talk title (required)
title: "Scalable Byzantine Agreement with Adaptive Adversaries"

# Date of the talk, format YYYY-MM-DD (required)
date: 2025-11-10

# Venue name (required)
venue: "ACM CCS 2025"

# Venue URL (optional)
venue_url: "https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/"

# Venue date if different from date (optional, format YYYY-MM-DD)
venue_date: 2025-11-10

# Venue location (optional)
venue_location: "Salt Lake City, UT, USA"

# Speakers -- same rules as publication authors (required)
authors:
  - jane-smith

# Focus areas (optional)
areas:
  - distributed-systems

# Research groups (optional)
groups:
  - consensuslab

# Cover image (optional). Place a file named featured.jpg or featured.png in the folder
resources:
  - title: featured-image
    src: featured.jpg

# Short description (optional)
abstract: "Jane Smith presents a new scalable Byzantine agreement protocol at ACM CCS 2025."
---
A brief overview of the talk content.

{{< youtube dQw4w9WgXcQ >}}
```

**YouTube videos:** Use the Hugo shortcode `{{< youtube VIDEO_ID >}}` in the body to embed a video. Extract the video ID from the YouTube URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` -> `dQw4w9WgXcQ`).

**Cover image:** Place a `featured.jpg` or `featured.png` in the talk folder and reference it in the `resources` frontmatter.

### Add a Blog Post

Create a folder in `content/blog/` with an `index.md` file.

**File:** `content/blog/my-post/index.md`

```yaml
---
# Post title (required)
title: "My Blog Post"

# Publication date, format YYYY-MM-DD (required)
date: 2025-06-01

# Short description shown in the blog listing (required)
summary: "A brief summary of what this post is about."

# Authors -- use author folder slugs (required)
authors:
  - jane-smith
---
The full blog post content goes here. Standard Markdown is supported:
headings, bold, italic, links, lists, code blocks, etc.
```

The post will appear at `/blog/my-post/` and in the blog listing at `/blog/`.

### Edit an Existing Page

Find the Markdown file in `content/` and edit it directly. Common tasks:

- **Update your bio:** Edit `content/authors/<your-slug>/_index.md`
- **Fix a publication title:** Edit `content/publications/<slug>/index.md`
- **Update a talk abstract:** Edit `content/talks/<slug>/index.md`
- **Update a blog post:** Edit `content/blog/<slug>/index.md`
- **Change your avatar:** Replace the image at `public/images/authors/<your-slug>/avatar.jpg`

## FA2 Data (Upgrade Economies & Governance)

The FA2 focus area has additional hand-curated data in `src/data/fa2/`. These are JSON files, not Markdown.

### Projects (`src/data/fa2/projects.json`)

Array of project objects. To add a project:

```json
{
  "uid": "unique-id",
  "name": "Project Name",
  "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "website": "https://example.com",
  "description": "One-line description.",
  "longDescription": "Longer description for the detail view.",
  "tier": "Tier 1",
  "tags": ["governance", "public-goods"]
}
```

### Impact Data (`src/data/fa2/impact.json`)

Contains headline metrics and initiative details for the impact dashboard. Edit the `highlights` array for top-level stats and the `initiatives` array for individual program metrics.

### Opportunity Spaces (`src/data/fa2/opportunityspaces.json`)

Contains the 4 opportunity spaces (Sovereign DPI, Climate Infrastructure, Public Goods Funding, Governance & Democracy) with descriptions, key assumptions, and tipping signals.

## File Naming Conventions

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Folder slugs are lowercase, hyphen-separated | `jane-smith`, `smith2025`, `ai-robotics` |
| Author profiles use `_index.md` (with underscore) | `content/authors/jane-smith/_index.md` |
| Publications and talks use `index.md` (no underscore) | `content/publications/smith2025/index.md` |
| Section index pages use `_index.md` | `content/research/_index.md` |
| Standalone pages use `<name>.md` | `content/outreach/grants.md` |

The **slug** (folder name) determines the URL. For example, `content/publications/smith2025/index.md` becomes `/publications/smith2025/`.

## Author References

When listing authors in a publication or talk, there are two formats:

- **PL team members:** Use the folder slug (no quotes). This creates a link to their profile.
  ```yaml
  authors:
    - jane-smith
    - david-dao
  ```
- **External collaborators:** Use their full name in quotes. Displayed as plain text.
  ```yaml
  authors:
    - jane-smith
    - "Alice Johnson"
    - "Bob Williams"
  ```

## Markdown Body

The text below the closing `---` of the frontmatter is the body. It supports:

- Standard Markdown: **bold**, *italic*, [links](url), lists, headings, code blocks
- Raw HTML (not sanitized)
- Hugo shortcodes: `{{< youtube VIDEO_ID >}}` for YouTube embeds

The body is rendered to HTML and displayed on the detail page. For publications, this is typically the abstract. For authors, this is the bio.

## Verifying Your Changes

Before submitting, always verify locally:

```bash
# 1. Start the dev server (rebuilds content automatically)
npm run dev

# 2. Check the relevant page in your browser at http://localhost:3000

# 3. Type-check (catches broken imports, missing fields, etc.)
npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Full production build (catches build-time errors)
npm run build
```

If the dev server is already running, you need to restart it (Ctrl+C, `npm run dev`) to pick up content changes -- the Markdown build step only runs at startup.

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming

Use lowercase hyphenated names:

```
add-jane-smith-profile
update-smith2025-abstract
fix-talk-venue-typo
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the emoji-prefix format:

```
✨ Add jane-smith author profile
🔧 Update smith2025 publication metadata
🐛 Fix typo in talk abstract
```

Common prefixes:
- `✨` Add new content
- `🔧` Update/edit existing content
- `🐛` Fix an error
- `♻️` Reorganize or refactor

### Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Verify locally (`npm run dev`, `npx tsc --noEmit`)
4. Commit and push
5. Open a pull request on GitHub
6. Once merged to `main`, Vercel auto-deploys to https://plresearch.org

## How the Build Works (Technical Details)

For those who want to understand the internals:

The prebuild script `scripts/build-content.mjs` runs before every `dev` and `build` command. It:

1. **Scans** each content directory (`publications/`, `authors/`, `talks/`, etc.)
2. **Discovers** Markdown files by looking for subdirectories containing `index.md` or `_index.md`, and standalone `.md` files (excluding `_index.md` at the directory level)
3. **Parses** each file with `gray-matter` to extract YAML frontmatter and Markdown body
4. **Renders** the Markdown body to HTML using `remark` + `remark-html` (with `sanitize: false` to allow raw HTML)
5. **Writes** 8 JSON files to `src/data/generated/`:
   - `publications.json` -- Sorted by date descending, excludes `unaffiliated: true`
   - `authors.json` -- Sorted by name alphabetically
   - `talks.json` -- Sorted by date descending
   - `tutorials.json` -- Top-level tutorials only
   - `outreach.json` -- Sorted by `weight` field
   - `blog.json` -- Sorted by date descending
   - `areas.json` -- All focus areas
   - `sections.json` -- Section index metadata (research, contact, outreach)
6. **Generates** two public files:
   - `public/feed.xml` -- RSS feed from the latest 20 publications + 10 talks
   - `public/search-index.json` -- Flat array for Fuse.js client-side search

The generated JSON is then imported by `src/lib/content.ts`, which exports typed arrays consumed by the App Router page components. This means **no filesystem access happens at runtime** -- all content is pre-compiled into static JSON.

### Discovery Rules

| Content Type | Location | File Pattern | Sorting |
|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Publications | `content/publications/<slug>/` | `index.md` | Date descending |
| Authors | `content/authors/<slug>/` | `_index.md` | Name A-Z |
| Talks | `content/talks/<slug>/` | `index.md` | Date descending |
| Tutorials | `content/tutorials/<slug>/` | `_index.md` | None (insertion order) |
| Blog | `content/blog/<slug>/` | `index.md` | Date descending |
| Areas | `content/areas/<slug>/` | `_index.md` | None (insertion order) |
| Outreach | `content/outreach/` | `<name>.md` | Weight ascending |
| Sections | `content/<name>/` | `_index.md` | N/A (keyed object) |

### Avatar Resolution

Author avatars are resolved at build time by checking `public/images/authors/<slug>/` for any file starting with `avatar`. The first match is used. If no file is found, `avatarPath` is `null` and a placeholder is shown.

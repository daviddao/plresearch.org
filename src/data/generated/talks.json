Especially when used in blockchain systems, where scalability is of great importance, purely asynchronous solutions suffer from high message complexity or strong assumptions that weaken the adversary. In particular, an adaptive adversary (roughly translating to DoS attacks in practice) is difficult to overcome without any synchrony assumptions while also keeping message complexity low. We are exploring an idea targeting exactly such an algorithm. Starting from Bracha’s algorithm for randomized Byzantine agreement with quadratic message complexity, we derive a protocol for multi-valued agreement with sub-quadratic message complexity.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube ktdc22teZxs >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"rwc23-yolan","title":"tlock: Practical timelock encryption based on threshold BLS","date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","venue":"Real World Crypto 23","venue_url":"","venue_location":"Tokyo, Japan","authors":["yolan-romailler"],"areas":["distributed-systems"],"abstract":"We present a practical construction and implementation of timelock encryption, in which a ciphertext is guaranteed to be decryptable only after some specified time has passed. We employ an existing threshold network, the League of Entropy, implementing threshold BLS in the context of Boneh and Franklin's identity-based encryption (IBE) At present this threshold network broadcasts BLS signatures over each round number, equivalent to the current time interval, and as such can be considered a decentralised key holder periodically publishing private keys for the IBE where identities are the round numbers. A noticeable advantage of this scheme is that only the encryptors and decryptors are required to perform any additional cryptographic operations; the threshold network can remain unaware of the TLE and does not have to change to support the scheme. We also release an open-source implementation of our scheme and a live web page that can be used in production now relying on the existing League of Entropy network acting as a distributed public randomness beacon service using threshold BLS signatures.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube Xh849Ij3lhU >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"wipo23-jorge","title":"A metaverse of walled gardens?","date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","venue":"WIPO Conversation on Intellectual Property and the Metaverse","venue_url":"https://webcast.wipo.int/video/WIPO_IP_CONV_GE_23_2023-03-29_AM_118938?startTime=773","venue_location":"Genève, Switzerland","authors":["jorge-soares"],"areas":[null],"abstract":"The way in which the development and commercialisation of the metaverse unfold may result in an open architecture for collaborative innovation and participation, or in a series of silos tightly controlled by a small number of commercial entities.

Child subnets are firewalled from parent subnets, have their own specific policies, and run a different consensus algorithm, increasing the network capacity and enabling new applications. Moreover, they benefit from the security of parent subnets by periodically checkpointing state.

We continue the study of SVC with two goals in mind: improving their efficiency and making them more suitable to decentralized settings. We address both problems by proposing a new notion for VC that we call incremental aggregation and that allows one to merge openings in a succinct way an unbounded number of times. This property leads to faster generation of openings via preprocessing and a method to generate openings in a distributed way. We then proceed to realize SVC with incremental aggregation. We provide two constructions in groups of unknown order. The first one, similarly to that of Boneh et al. (which supports only one-hop aggregation), has constant-size public parameters, commitments and openings. As an additional feature for this construction we propose efficient arguments of knowledge of subvector openings which immediately yields a keyless proof of storage with compact proofs. For our second construction, we propose an incremental aggregation method for the SVC of Lai-Malavolta; this has linear-size parameters but faster openings. Finally, we address a problem closely related to that of SVC: storing a file efficiently in completely decentralized networks. We introduce and construct verifiable decentralized storage (VDS), a cryptographic primitive that allows to check the integrity of a file stored by a network of nodes in a distributed and decentralized way. Our VDS constructions rely on our new vector commitment techniques.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube MFJMWA0Pk1s >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"plr20-michael","title":"Decentralized energy grid: A Protocol Labs independent research project","date":"2020-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","venue":"Protocol Labs Research Talks","venue_url":"","venue_location":"","authors":["michael-hammersley","alan-ransil"],"areas":["distributed-power-systems"],"abstract":"Protocol Labs researcher Michael Hammersley discusses the current state of his work on a decentralized energy grid, a shared project with Alan Ransil, another researcher at Protocol Labs.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube Xh80OzmaiGc >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"plr20-nicolas","title":"Drand: Distributed, bias resistant, unpredictable and publicly verifiable randomness","date":"2020-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","venue":"Protocol Labs Research Talks","venue_url":"","venue_location":"","authors":["nicolas-gailly"],"areas":["distributed-systems"],"abstract":"A talk by Nicolas Gailly, Research Scientist at Protocol Labs, March 4, 2020","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube ydwW2HFFxNI >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"syco5-davidad","title":"Dioptics: A common generalization of open games and gradient-based learners","date":"2019-09-06 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"SYCO 5","venue_url":"http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/strings3-syco5/","venue_location":"Birmingham, UK","authors":["david-dalrymple"],"areas":["applied-category-theory"],"abstract":"David Dalrymple (Protocol Labs Research) talks about Dioptics at SYCO 5.","html":"<p><a href=\"https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=39acddd8-e131-4b3f-9704-aabf00bec4e7\">{{&#x3C; image \"featured.png\" >}}</a></p>\n"},{"slug":"consensusday1-brian","title":"Single secret leader election","date":"2019-02-02 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"ConsensusDay 1","venue_url":"","venue_location":"Stanford, CA, USA","authors":["brian-vohaska"],"areas":["cryptography","distributed-systems"],"abstract":"Brian Vohaska (Filecoin Research) talks about SSLE at ConsensusDay 1.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube _ha6abiM0Uw >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"consensusday1-evan","title":"Mergeable consensus","date":"2019-02-02 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"ConsensusDay 1","venue_url":"","venue_location":"Stanford, CA, USA","authors":["evan-miyazono"],"areas":["distributed-systems"],"abstract":"Evan Miyazono (Protocol Labs Research) talks about mergeable consensus at ConsensusDay 1.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube WPPWT-GrhTs >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"consensusday1-henri","title":"Expected consensus","date":"2019-02-02 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"ConsensusDay 1","venue_url":"","venue_location":"Stanford, CA, USA","authors":["henri-stern"],"areas":["distributed-systems"],"abstract":"Henri Stern (Filecoin Research) talks about expected consensus at ConsensusDay 1.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube pUIVMG4ZS2E >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"consensusday1-juan","title":"Consensus hierarchies","date":"2019-02-02 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"ConsensusDay 1","venue_url":"","venue_location":"Stanford, CA, USA","authors":["juan-benet"],"areas":["distributed-systems"],"abstract":"Juan Benet (Protocol Labs CEO) talks about consensus hierarchies at ConsensusDay 1.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube UjSWTW4ioMs >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"consensusday1-juan2","title":"New directions in consensus","date":"2019-02-02 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"ConsensusDay 1","venue_url":"","venue_location":"Stanford, CA, USA","authors":["juan-benet"],"areas":["distributed-systems"],"abstract":"Juan Benet (Protocol Labs CEO) talks about new directions in consensus at ConsensusDay 1.","html":"<p>{{&#x3C; youtube acxanKhQ3Ek >}}</p>\n"},{"slug":"labday18-alan","title":"Developing an open source energy trading protocol","date":"2018-10-23 14:19:14 +0100","venue":"Lab Day 2018","venue_url":"","venue_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","authors":["alan-ransil"],"areas":["distributed-power-systems"],"abstract":"In order to decarbonize the power grid, we will make increasing use of resources at the grid edge such as wind, solar and batteries.

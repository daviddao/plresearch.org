A few years ago he discovered the world of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. He sees it as a fascinating potential meeting place of beautiful theoretical computer science ideas and real-world applications. Motivated by this, he shifted his focus in 2014 from pure theory into making tools such as Zero-Knowledge proofs more practical and efficient. Notably, he contributed to the original deployment of Zcash and later discovered and helped mitigate a critical counterfeiting bug.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Evan is the team lead for Research at Protocol Labs.  He has lived in California his whole life, bouncing between NorCal and SoCal. He spent enough of his childhood at beaches that a sandy shore always feels familiar; the rest was spent sitting at a computer, reading books, or disassembling things. He eventually majored in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford after unintentionally picking up minors in math and CS. He was then driven by his curiosity to a PhD in Applied Physics at Caltech and, upon completion, was lead to Protocol Labs by a desire to build systems that affect real people.</p>\n<p>Evan still loves beaches, reading, and disassembly. Figuring out how things do, should, or could work is a passion, and sharing that knowledge is a favorite hobby. He'll go on for hours if you tell him you're interested in his thesis, so set a time limit before starting on that particular odyssey of quantum optics and nanofabrication.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Yiannis has a long-standing interest in Information- or Content-Centric Networks with several noteworthy contributions in the area. He has extensive background in several of the architectural and protocol design aspects of Information-Centric Networks having run several projects over the last decade. He sees IPFS as a deployment of ICN in the wild with a huge user-base and is therefore excited to contribute his past experience into the protocol design choices of a live network. Yiannis is active in the ICN research community and the IRTF ICNRG. In the past, he has worked in areas related to congestion control, routing, caching, naming and resource allocation of current and future fixed and mobile Internet architectures. He believes that decentralisation of Internet services will be demanded through the need to deploy services at the edge of the network, aka edge-computing. A brief  thesis on this together with related works can be found here: https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~ipsaras/ddec.html</p>\n"

He introduced the first practical fault attack against the EdDSA signature scheme and orchestrated the full disclosure with PoC of the CurveBall vulnerability. Nowadays he's working on the distributed randomness project, drand, studying pairing-based cryptography, distributed key generation, and threshold systems. His most recent work was focused around Timelock Encryption.</p>\n"

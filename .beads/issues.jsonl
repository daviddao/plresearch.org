{"id":"plresearch.org-epv.2","title":"Enhance DependencyGraph component: multi-gate columns and feedback loop edges","description":"## Files\n- src/app/areas/economies-governance/dependency-graph/DependencyGraph.tsx (modify)\n\n## What to do\nExtend the existing graph rendering to support TWO new features needed by the subpages:\n\n### 1. Multiple Gates\nCurrently each IP has a single `gate: GateConfig`. Change to an array:\n\n```ts\ntype GateConfig = { id: string; label: string; quarter: string } // add quarter field e.g. 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'Q1 2026'\n\ntype IPConfig = {\n  // ... existing fields ...\n  gates: GateConfig[]  // RENAMED from 'gate' to 'gates', now an array\n  // ... rest same ...\n}\n```\n\nLayout changes for multi-gate:\n- The gate column becomes wider. Each gate gets stacked vertically like bottlenecks are now (with BN_GAP-style spacing).\n- Each gate shows its quarter label (e.g. 'Q2') as a tiny superscript above the gate text.\n- Edges: ALL bottlenecks connect to the FIRST gate. Each gate connects to the next gate in sequence (left→right within the gate column, using short horizontal curves). The LAST gate fans out to all strands.\n- Alternatively (simpler): stack gates vertically, bottlenecks → all gates (fan), last gate → strands. Use the simpler approach.\n\n### 2. Feedback Loops\nAdd a new optional field to IPConfig:\n\n```ts\ntype FeedbackLoop = {\n  id: string\n  from: string   // node id (strand or intervention)\n  to: string     // node id (bottleneck, gate, or strand)\n  label: string  // short label like 'Evidence compounds'\n}\n\ntype IPConfig = {\n  // ... existing fields ...\n  feedbackLoops?: FeedbackLoop[]\n}\n```\n\nRendering feedback loops:\n- Draw as dashed curved arrows going RIGHT-TO-LEFT (backwards), colored with a muted teal (#0D9488, opacity 0.3).\n- The curve should arc BELOW the main graph area (add ~60px extra bottom padding when feedbackLoops exist).\n- Path: from the source node's bottom-center, curve down below the graph, back up to the target node's bottom-center.\n- Add a small arrowhead at the target end.\n- On hover of a feedback loop edge, show a tooltip with the loop's label.\n- Add 'Feedback loop' to the legend when feedbackLoops exist, using the teal color + dashed style.\n\n### 3. Export changes\n- Keep the default export `DependencyGraph` that renders all IPs (for backwards compat)\n- ALSO export `IPFigure` as a named export so subpages can render a single IP\n- ALSO export `ipConfigs` so subpages can reference existing data\n- ALSO export all types: `IPConfig`, `GateConfig`, `StrandConfig`, `BottleneckConfig`, `InterventionConfig`, `FeedbackLoop`\n\n### 4. Backward compat\nUpdate the existing `ipConfigs` data to use `gates: [{ ...existingGate, quarter: 'Q4' }]` (single-element arrays) so the old all-IPs view still works.\n\n## Don't\n- Don't change the color palette or tooltip styling\n- Don't change the existing card rendering (renderCard function shape)\n- Don't remove any existing tooltip data\n- Don't add npm dependencies","acceptance_criteria":"1.

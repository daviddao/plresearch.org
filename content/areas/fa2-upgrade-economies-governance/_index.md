FA2 focuses on building the field of crypto-native economic and governance infrastructure. This mission aims to rectify the inadequacies of current macro systems, which often struggle to coordinate and solve monumental challenges like climate change.

By leveraging cryptoeconomics and improved governance tools, we are rethinking how capital is formed and deployed (e.g., Public Goods Funding). This movement harnesses mechanism design to align millions of people worldwide toward shared goals, creating more efficient and equitable structures that can allocate resources at the scale of nation-states for the benefit of all humanity.

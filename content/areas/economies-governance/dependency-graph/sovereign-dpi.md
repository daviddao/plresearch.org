tooltip:
  title: "Inflection Point 1: Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure"
  body: "A nation-state successfully runs core digital systems — identity, payments, registries — on open, verifiable crypto-rails and gains measurable advantages over centralized incumbents."
  context: "Proving grounds: Bhutan (780K pop.), Argentina/Crecimiento (10K+ builders), Edge City villages. Multilaterals have moved from skepticism to active engagement."

bottlenecks:
  - id: b1a
    label: "Can open infra outperform centralized on sovereign metrics? (UPI succeeded because centralized)"
    tooltip:
      title: "Centralized Infra May Win"
      body: "Can decentralized infrastructure actually outperform centralized alternatives on metrics sovereigns care about? India's UPI and Brazil's PIX succeeded precisely because they were centralized enough for governments to mandate adoption."
      context: "This is the core testable hypothesis. The Sovereign Stack Challenge (3–5 competing teams) is designed to produce evidence by Q4. If open infra can't match centralized on uptime, throughput, and cost — the thesis needs revision, not abandonment."
  - id: b1b
    label: "'Sovereign-grade' undefined — uptime, security, accessibility, disaster recovery specs unknown"
    tooltip:
      title: "'Sovereign-Grade' Undefined"
      body: "What does 'sovereign-grade' actually require? Uptime guarantees, security standards, accessibility requirements, disaster recovery — these specifications might be significantly harder than the crypto community appreciates."
      context: "The gap between a working demo and sovereign-grade production may be a chasm, not a step. Edge City prototypes help surface these requirements empirically rather than theoretically."
  - id: b1c
    label: "Political champion fragility — Bhutan interest may not survive government changes"
    tooltip:
      title: "Political Champion Fragility"
      body: "Is Bhutan's interest durable beyond individual champions? Sovereign engagement that depends on one minister or one monarch is fragile. Government changes could derail years of engagement overnight."
      context: "Risk Register R12: Maintain 2–3 parallel sovereign conversations (Uruguay, Estonia, Argentina sub-national). Fellowship cohort diversifies institutional access. Never concentrate in one jurisdiction."

    label: "Pilot-to-production gap — dozens of Digital Public Infrastructure pilots went nowhere [Shared Blocker]"
    tooltip:
      title: "Pilot-to-Production Gap"
      body: "Can pilots convert to production? The field has produced dozens of promising Digital Public Infrastructure pilots that went nowhere. We do not know whether this is a technology problem, a political problem, or a market problem."
      context: "Shared Blocker across all 4 IPs. The Q4 decision gate (1,000+ real users, 30+ continuous days) is deliberately set to test production viability, not just pilot feasibility."

gates:
  - id: g1q2
    label: "At least 1 team achieves 100+ users on a working prototype"
    quarter: Q2
    tooltip:
      title: "Q2 Gate: Prototype Traction"
      body: "Can any Sovereign Stack team attract 100+ genuine users to a working prototype? This filters teams with real product-market signal from pure R&D."
      context: "Kill criterion: if zero teams reach 100 users by Q2, reassess whether the challenge framing attracts viable teams."
  - id: g1q3
    label: "Formal MoU signed with at least 1 sovereign entity for pilot deployment"
    quarter: Q3
    tooltip:
      title: "Q3 Gate: Sovereign Commitment"
      body: "Has any sovereign entity formalized interest beyond meetings? An MoU signals institutional willingness to risk political capital on open infrastructure."
      context: "Bhutan MoU target. Fallback: Uruguay or Estonia sub-national agreement. The bar is written commitment, not verbal interest."
  - id: g1
    label: "1,000+ real users on open infrastructure for 30+ continuous days with performance parity"
    quarter: Q4
    tooltip:
      title: "Q4 Gate: Sovereign Services"
      body: "Can any team demonstrate a core government service running on open infrastructure, serving 1,000+ real users, with performance parity vs. the status quo?"
      context: "If YES — double down, seek formal sovereign pilot. If NO — diagnose bottleneck: technology, UX, political will, or market fit."

    label: "Cost parity with centralized alternative demonstrated; second sovereign engagement initiated"
    quarter: "Q1 2026"
    tooltip:
      title: "Q1 2026 Gate: Cost & Scale"
      body: "Can the production system demonstrate total cost of ownership at or below centralized alternatives? A second sovereign engagement validates generalizability."
      context: "Cost parity is the unlock for institutional adoption beyond early-adopter nations. Without it, open infra remains a values proposition, not an economic one."

num: "03"

tooltip:
  title: "Inflection Point 3: Governance & Democracy"
  body: "Crypto-native governance adopted because existing institutions can no longer credibly claim authority without it. Cities allocate budgets via crypto; governance tooling enters reform."
  context: "Edge City: 4 villages, 11K+ residents. Deliberative tools proven in civic contexts. Democratic institutions face global legitimacy crisis."

bottlenecks:
  - id: b3a
    label: "No agreed definition of 'better governance' — different stakeholders want different things"
    tooltip:
      title: "No Definition of 'Better Governance'"
      body: "Does 'better governance' have a clear definition? Faster decisions? More representative? More efficient allocation? Higher satisfaction? Different stakeholders want different things."
      context: "The Governance Observatory addresses this by pre-registering metrics before each experiment — forcing explicit definition of what 'better' means in each context before measuring."
  - id: b3b
    label: "Pop-up to permanent city gap — self-selected tech residents differ from diverse populations"
    tooltip:
      title: "Pop-up to Permanent City Gap"
      body: "Do pop-up city innovations transfer to permanent cities? A month-long village with self-selected tech-savvy residents is radically different from a permanent city with diverse, unselected populations and entrenched interests."
      context: "Risk Register R10: Deliberately test in non-tech communities (cooperatives, mutual aid groups, neighborhood associations). If transfer fails, critical to know early."
  - id: b3c
    label: "Crypto component unproven — Pol.is & QV work without blockchain"
    tooltip:
      title: "Crypto Component May Add Nothing"
      body: "Is 'deliberative + crypto' actually better than 'deliberative alone'? Pol.is works without blockchain. Quadratic voting works without crypto. What specifically does the crypto component add beyond tamper-proof records?"
      context: "The Deliberative + Crypto research strand (2–3 teams) tests this directly. The crypto component needs to earn its place through demonstrated advantage, not assumed superiority."
  - id: b3d
    label: "No sovereign-grade identity infrastructure exists [Shared Blocker]"
    tooltip:
      title: "Identity Infrastructure Gap"
      body: "Identity remains the blocker. Most governance innovations require identity infrastructure that doesn't exist at sovereign grade. Solving this through usage-based reputation is a hypothesis, not a proven approach."
      context: "Shared Blocker across all 4 IPs. Progress on identity for any IP accelerates all others. This is the highest-leverage cross-cutting challenge."

    label: "3+ Edge City villages instrumented with pre-registered governance metrics and baseline data collected"
    quarter: Q2
    tooltip:
      title: "Q2 Gate: Observatory Baseline"
      body: "Are Edge City villages producing rigorous, pre-registered governance data? Without baseline measurements, we cannot evaluate whether any intervention improves outcomes."
      context: "The Governance Observatory must instrument villages BEFORE governance experiments begin. Retroactive measurement is scientifically worthless for causal claims."
  - id: g3q3
    label: "At least 1 non-tech community pilot launched — cooperative, mutual aid, or neighborhood association"
    quarter: Q3
    tooltip:
      title: "Q3 Gate: Beyond Tech Bubble"
      body: "Can governance tooling work for people who are not self-selected crypto-native residents? This is the transfer test from pop-up to permanent."
      context: "Risk Register R10 flag. Target: cooperative (500+ members), mutual aid network, or neighborhood association. If tooling requires crypto literacy, it fails this gate."

    quarter: Q4
    tooltip:
      title: "Q4 Gate: Governance Participation"
      body: "Can any tooling achieve 50%+ participation in a community of 500+ people for a real decision with real stakes?"
      context: "If YES — double down, begin city engagement. If NO — diagnose: UX? Incentives? Do people not want to participate?"

    quarter: "Q1 2026"
    tooltip:
      title: "Q1 2026 Gate: Institutional Adoption"
      body: "Has any city or municipal government used crypto-native governance tooling for a real budget decision? This is the ultimate proof that the tools have crossed from experiment to institution."
      context: "Edge City provides the proof-of-concept, but institutional adoption requires navigating procurement, legal frameworks, and political risk that pop-up cities never face."
